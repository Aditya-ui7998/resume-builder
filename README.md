# Resume Builder 


## Project Goal

This tool helps simplify the process of building professional, ATS-compliant, and visually appealing resumes using structured user-provided data. By separating content from design, this project empowers users to:
- Quickly update your resume without worrying about formatting.
- Maintain a consistent and polished appearance.
- Generate PDF resumes that:
    - Include icons, hyperlinks, and logos where appropriate.
    - Are ATS-compatible to ensure resumes are parsed correctly by job application systems.
    - Present information in a clean, modern layout with multiple template options.
- Highly flexible YAML file to design your resume. Use one of our preexisting templates from the `templates/` folder.
