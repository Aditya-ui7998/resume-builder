          What Makes a Professional Summary Effective?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          An effective professional summary is a 3-4 sentence paragraph that
          combines your years of experience, key skills, notable achievements,
          and the value you bring to employers. It should be tailored to your
          target role and industry while showcasing what makes you unique.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          A compelling professional summary can significantly impact your job
          search success. It should immediately communicate your value
          proposition, highlight your most relevant qualifications, and
          encourage recruiters to continue reading. Use the examples and
          templates in this guide as starting points, but always customize your
          summary for each specific opportunity.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-6">
          Remember that your professional summary is often the first-and
          sometimes only-section recruiters read. Make those few seconds count
          by crafting a summary that positions you as the ideal candidate for
          your target role.
