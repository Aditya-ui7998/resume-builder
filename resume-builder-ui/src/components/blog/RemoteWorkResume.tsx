          Remote work is no longer just a perk - it's a permanent shift in how
          we work. In 2025, standing out in the digital job market means
          crafting a resume tailored for remote roles, highlighting your
          adaptability, self-management, and communication skills that remote
          employers value most.

            📈 Remote Work Growth
          </h3>
          <p className="text-blue-700">
            Remote jobs have grown by over 150% in the last five years,
            according to FlexJobs. As more companies embrace remote-first
            policies, competition for these roles has intensified significantly.

          Why Remote-Ready Resumes Matter
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Traditional resumes may not cut it anymore in the remote job market.
          Recruiters now look for clear signals that candidates can thrive
          without the structure of a traditional office. Your resume needs to
          instantly communicate your ability to be productive, communicative,
          and reliable in a remote setting.

          How to Tailor Your Resume for Remote Jobs
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          1. Add "Remote" to Job Titles or Locations
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Make it clear which roles were remote by adding "(Remote)" next to
          your job title or city. This signals relevant experience immediately
          and helps ATS systems identify your remote work background.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">
          2. Use a Summary That Highlights Remote Fit
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Your professional summary should include remote-related keywords like
          "remote collaboration," "self-motivated," or "distributed teams."
          Here's an example:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">

            "Self-driven software engineer with 6+ years of experience in

          The Future of Remote Work
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Remote work isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's expected that over 25%
          of professional jobs will be remote by the end of 2025. If you're
          aiming for flexibility, freedom, or access to global opportunities,
          your resume needs to reflect that reality.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-6">
          Tailor your resume to speak the language of remote employers. Show
          that you're proactive, reliable, and already comfortable working in
          distributed environments. The right words and proper formatting can
          make your resume rise to the top-no matter where you're applying from.
