        Writing a cover letter in 2025 is no longer a formality - it's a
        strategic tool that can tip the scales in your favor. Done right, your
        cover letter can spark interest, show personality, and explain exactly
        why you belong at the company.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Cover Letters Still Matter in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        According to a recent survey by ResumeLab, 83% of hiring managers say a
        strong cover letter can land you an interview even if your resume isn't
        perfect. While some recruiters skim or skip them, many still expect one
        - especially for roles in marketing, communications, education, and
        leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in a world of LinkedIn profiles and AI screening, a well-crafted
        cover letter shows effort, interest, and professionalism.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes a Cover Letter Stand Out</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personalization:</strong> Use the hiring manager's name if
          available and mention the company specifically.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storytelling:</strong> Share a brief anecdote or success that
          connects your experience to the role.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarity:</strong> Be concise - ideally 3 to 4 short
          paragraphs, maximum one page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Energy:</strong> Show enthusiasm for the role and company.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tie-in:</strong> Explain how your skills can solve their
          problems or help them grow.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Structure Your Cover Letter</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Header:</strong> Include your contact info, date, and the
          hiring manager's details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Greeting:</strong> Address the letter to a person, not "To
          whom it may concern" if you can help it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opening Paragraph:</strong> Introduce yourself and state why
          you’re applying. Hook their attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Middle Paragraph(s):</strong> Highlight relevant experience
          and link it to what the job needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closing Paragraph:</strong> Reiterate your excitement and
          invite further conversation or interview.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sign-Off:</strong> Use a polite close like "Sincerely" or
          "Best regards," and your full name.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Common Cover Letter Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using the same generic letter for every job.</li>
        <li>Repeating your resume word-for-word.</li>
        <li>Sounding too formal, robotic, or impersonal.</li>
        <li>Not addressing it to a real person when possible.</li>
        <li>Being vague about why you’re applying.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        A good cover letter shows that you’ve done your homework, care about the
        role, and know how to communicate - all qualities employers value. Even
        if the company doesn’t require one, it can be a strategic advantage that
        sets you apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use your cover letter to tell the story your resume can’t. With a little
        time and the right strategy, yours can make a lasting impression in a
        noisy hiring world.
